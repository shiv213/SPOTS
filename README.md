# SPOTS (Stored Parts Optical Tracking System)

## 🎯 Overview
SPOTS is an intelligent parts management system that combines computer vision and automated pointing to help you quickly locate items in storage drawers. Using a camera for continuous monitoring and a gimbaled laser pointer for indication, SPOTS maintains a real-time database of part locations and can guide you to the exact drawer containing your desired component.
